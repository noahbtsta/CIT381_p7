# Project 7

For this project I made this Github website that you are on right now. One of the main challenges
of this assignment was figuring out how to link one repository to another. However, I was able to 
figure it out through reseach and trial and error. This project is one of my favorites because it 
allows me to showcase all my work through out this term. 


### Skills Used in Project
- Creating repositories
- Linking repos
- Linking images in Github
- Creating folders in Github
- Editing readME.md files to provide easy to ready pages

- Organizing my work so that its easy to navigate

Here is a photo of how many repos I created (one for each project and lab):
